This repository containts my Bachelor Thesis that concluded my Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence, awarded by the University of Groningen with a grade of 8.5/10. I created an agent-based simulation in python that investigated the dynamics of swarm intelligence. 

# Abstract

The organisation of organisms as a group yields many advantages. However, to develop
and maintain group cohesion, the group will have to make decisions as a whole. The fact
that many animals exhibit limited information-sharing capacities and still manage to act and
solve problems as a whole indicates the need to further investigate the dynamics of decision making
in groups. This emergent property known as Swarm Intelligence can be modelled through
an agent-based model. This study replicated and validated a previously conducted agent-based
simulation of a honeybee swarm’s ability to choose the best possible nest site in regards to their
independence and interdependence. Furthermore, this paper expands previous research by simulating
habitat and population loss and their effect on the groups’ decision making capabilities.
Results showed a successful replication of the agent-based model and the expansion illustrated
a negative effect on nest-site choice when population and habitats are reduced.
